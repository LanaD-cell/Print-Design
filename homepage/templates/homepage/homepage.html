    <p class="card-text">We are a passionate, dynamic collaboration between myself,
      Illana, and my sister-in-law, Wilri. With years of experience in various
      industries, we have come together to offer a unique combination of creativity,
      technical expertise, and practical knowledge in the graphic design and printing
      sectors.</p>

      <h4 class="card-subtitle mb-2">About Us</h4>
    <p class="card-text">At Print & Design, we specialize in delivering high-quality
      design services and offering affordable printing solutions to businesses and
      individuals alike. With a strong foundation in graphic design, marketing, and
      full-stack programming, we are well-equipped to handle your design and printing
      needsâ€”from concept to creation.

      I, Illana, hold a degree in logistics, with years of experience in graphic
      design and marketing, particularly in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)
      sector. This experience has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of
      branding and design strategy, while honing my skills in delivering tailored
      solutions for diverse business needs. Most recently, I earned my full-stack
      programming qualifications, which allows us to bring more advanced,
      tech-savvy services to the table.

      Wilri, my sister-in-law, is an expert in graphic design, and her creativity
      and artistic eye ensure that every project we take on is aesthetically
      compelling and impactful. Together, our combined knowledge and expertise
      give us a unique edge in providing both exceptional design services and
      the ability to print your products at competitive pricing.

      Our vision is to offer a one-stop solution for all your design and printing
      needs. Whether you're looking to create professional branding, print marketing
      materials, or bring your custom designs to life, we are here to make your
      vision a reality. We strive to make quality design accessible and affordable,
      helping you stand out in today's competitive market.
